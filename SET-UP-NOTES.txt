Folder permissions (modify):

    1.) F:\     ... NETWORKSERVICE

Create Windows Defender folder exclusion for G:\hMailServer\Data


Import certificates - CA, Intermediate  
    - nb: mail.xarta.co.uk entered in hMailServer settings with key


Disable IPV6:   to make scripted hMailServer & mysqldump etc. binding easier
                TODO: work this out ... want to support IPV6 !!!


INSTALL mySQL

    - mysql-installer-community-5.7.17.0-includes-workbench-32BIT.msi
    - ... CUSTOM:   SERVER, WORKBENCH, UTILITIES, CONNECTOR/NET & C++, DOCS
    - ...           MAYBE: NOTIFIER, ODBC CONNECTOR
    - click on things to resolve (.NET runtime etc.) and press execute
        (it's lying when it says nothing to do)
    -   (might lie about failure too)
    - execute installation of all the sub-products
    - CONFIGURE:
    - ... Server machine, 3306, no firewall opening (localhost only)
    - ... add ROOT PASSWORD (LastPass)
    - ... add user: hMailServer
            localhost
            DB Admin           TODO: REVIEW THIS ***
            MySQL (authentication)
            Password - see Xarta.json

    *** ... bear in mind I now use this account to create the dump account.
            really I only need to make the dump account at the beginning - 
            so need a separate set-up script for that to run under root ...
        ... asking for root input & using powershell secure password? ...
        ... and change hMailServer to least privaledge for hMailServer app

    - Windows Service - defaults
    - Not using as a document store
    - Error log: F:\sql\error.log
    - General log: none
    - Slow Query log: F:\sql\slow.log  5-seconds
    - Bin Log - leave alone

    - Execute / Finish
    - DO NOT START WORKBENCH (want to change mysql ini location first!)

    - Open services.msc
    - Look for mySQL ... properties ... defaults-file
    - STOP SERVICE
    - Example: "C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\my.ini"
    - Copy my.ini from that location to F:\sql\prog\my.ini
    - Search & replace every occurance in the registry ... regedit
    - close/re-open service properties - check default path

    - COPY data directory to F: drive

    - EDIT my.ini
    - ...	datadir = "F:/sql/data\"	(trying without quotes F:/sql\data)
    - ...	innodb_log_buffer_size=1M 	(default)
    - ...	innodb_buffer_pool_size=100M	
    - ...	innodb_log_file_size=25M
    - ...	innodb_thread_concurrency=8 ??? change this? (to 4?)
    - ...	innodb_buffer_pool_instances=4

    - START SERVICE

    - Using mysql notifier - manage instance (opens Workbench)
    - Workbench preferences: Administration: Data Export and Import
    - ... Edit all 3 paths to match the server installation directory,
    - ... C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysqldump.exe
    - ... C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\bin\mysql.exe
    - ... and, G:\mysql_dump for the dump directory



INSTALL hMailServer

    - find appropriate version of mysql dll e.g. 32bit = libmysql.dll 
    - ... likely in C:\Program Files\MySQL\MySQL Server 5.7\lib
    - ... and paste it into a new Bin folder: G:\hMailServer\Bin

    - Run hMailServer set-up ... install to G:\hMailServer (save ver as import source)
    - Password is for hMailServer administrator (nothing to do with mySQL)
    - Will install .Net dependencies
    - Same password again ... now onto databases

    - CREATE default database ... "hmailserver" and "hMailServer" user credentials
    - ... on local host ... and dependent service will be the mySQL one


    AT THIS POINT WE HAVE A WORKING hMailServer with no settings/domains

    BUT:    services.msc ... change hMailServer service log-on to use
            the hMailServer Windows account added earlier (password in Xarta.json)


INSTALL OTHER SOFTWARE:

    - 7zip
    - Git (clone scripts) (remember the gui thingy for .ignore files)
    - XCA
    - VS CODE  (publish) & (remember gist token for settings - see detailed note)
    - NotePad Plus PLus

IF THIS IS A VM, HALT AT THIS POINT.

    - 1 COPY FOR mail4.xarta.co.uk BACKUP SYSTEM  (backup for    mail4 compute stick)
    - 1 COPY FOR mail2.xarta.co.uk OPERATIONAL MX (additional to mail1 compute stick)


External: 81.137.121.100
Internal: 192.168.3.51 (compute stick), 54 (VM)
mail4.xarta.co.uk

    - stop services, of course
    - IMPORT mySQL (which includes existing HMS settings)
    - IMPORT HMS data ("extract" from 7zip)
    - Check incoming relays (mail1 & mail2)
    - SMTP: Bind to local IP address and local host name = mail4.xarta.co.uk
    - Check pfSense routing, split DNS, any security settings, BT rDNS
    - Check certificates & DKIM paths & DNS
    - XartaBackup.vbs   => set-up scheduler for back-ups
    - Check can connect to network SAMBA Back-up folder
    - WHEN READY, BLOCK ALL PORTS EXCEPT 587 AND 993 (EXTERNAL)
    - AND ONLY ALLOW AUTHENTICATED PORT 25 INTERNAL? (FROM RELAYS)
    - ASSUMES ANY SPAM IS MARKED AS SPAM BY MX'S ... AND REVIEW
    - PERMISSIONS TO SEND MAIL TO EXTERNALS ... NOT SURE OF PERMISSIVE CONFIGS
    - TODO: reverse proxy 587 & 993?  Can I do that with pfSense package?

    - UPDATE CLIENTS? should be fine - imap.xarta.co.uk & smtp.xarta.co.uk set
    - ... in public DNS ... and self-signed certificates should be fine for a while
    - ... or if changing to Lets Encrypt won't need to change anything anyway

External: mail2 = 81.137.121.98, mail1 = 81.137.121.97
Internal: 192.168.2.0 net single addresses
mail2.xarta.co.uk & mail1.xarta.co.uk

    - route each domain to hold/forward to mail4.xarta.co.uk (split DNS in pfSense?)
    - SMTP Bind to local IP
    - SMTP local host name = mail2.xarta.co.uk (& mail1.xarta.co.uk)
    - Set-up spam assassin on either mail1 or mail2 (choose) **
    - Set-up anti-virus ... either Clam on Ubuntu VM maybe, or Windows defender
    - Check certificates
    - Bear in mind want to move to using STARTSSL internally
    - THESE SHOULD ONLY BE ON PORT 25 (IN) AND STARTSSL TO INTERNAL MAIL4 PORT 25

    ** =>

    *********
    REMEMBER: either mail1 or mail2 or both also set-up as IIS reverse proxy for websites
    ********* + MQTT perimeter hub
